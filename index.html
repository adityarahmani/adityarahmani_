                <p>A website, also written as Web site,[1] web site, or simply site,[2] is a set of related web pages
                    containing content (media) such as text, image, video, audio, etc. A website is
                    hosted on at least one web server, accessible via a network such as the Internet or a private local
                    area network through an Internet address known as a Uniform Resource Locator. All publicly
                    accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p>A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text interspersed with formatting instructions of
                    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML, XHTML). A webpage may incorporate elements from other websites with
                    suitable markup anchors.</p>
                <p>Webpages are accessed and transported with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which may
                    optionally employ encryption (HTTP Secure, HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user of
                    the webpage content. The user's application, often a web browser, renders the page content according
                    to its HTML markup instructions onto a display terminal.</p>
                <p>The pages of a website can usually be accessed from a simple Uniform Resource Locator (URL) called
                    the web address. The URLs of the pages organize them into a hierarchy, although hyperlinking between
                    them conveys the reader's perceived site structure and guides the reader's navigation of the site
                    which generally includes a home page with most of the links to the site's web content, and a
                    supplementary about, contact and link page.</p>
                <p>Some websites require a subscription to access some or all of their content. Examples of subscription
                    websites include many business sites, parts of news websites, academic journal websites, gaming
                    websites, file-sharing websites, message boards, web-based email, social networking websites,
                    websites providing real-time stock market data, and websites providing various other services (e.g.,
                    websites offering storing and/or sharing of images, files and so forth).</p>
